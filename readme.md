# junk-lang

This is an interpreted programming language created by following along with the book `Writing An Interpreter In Go` by Thorsten Ball found here: (https://interpreterbook.com/).

My language name and some semantics will differ a bit from the book and I may add more functionality over time. This is a project done for fun, and is not really mean to be a truly viable production ready language.
